A simple JS quiz. Any question can be added. The HTML file is just for demo purposes.
It is entirely front-end built, using JS for adding programming logic.
The reason I choose JS over PHP is because of its simplicity, the program
does not require a server-side language which will only make the program
run slower since at every execution, it would need to connect to the server
while with JS, the only requirement is the user browser to support JS.
Working example of the program can be found here - http://studyingthepast.com/quiz
